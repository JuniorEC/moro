# moro
CLI tool for simple time tracking, very simple.

## install

```
npm install -g moro
```
It works best for 9 to 5 jobs, as there's no start/stop task feature.


```
$: moro
your start of the day is set at 9:00

$ moro
your end of the day is set to 17:00

$ moro
you worked for 7:30

```

It removes half an hour for the lunch time.
